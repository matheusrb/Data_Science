# Matheus R. Bernardes
<sub>*Optimization Analyst* at ihm Stefanini</sub>

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience as a field PLC programmer, honing my resilience, problem-solving creativity, and agile logical reasoning. Recently, as an optimization analyst, I successfully optimized energy consumption in steel mills using Python for data analysis and automation. Leveraging exploratory data analysis and time series validation, I generated valuable insights and validated improvement strategies. My background as a Control and Automation Engineer, complemented by my specialization in Industry 4.0 from INATEL, enabled me to apply theoretical and practical principles to identify opportunities and implement effective solutions, aligning with the industry's digital transformation goals.

I utilized Python as a key tool to develop efficient solutions and automate data acquisition and reporting, contributing to an efficient workflow. This approach reflects the Industry 4.0 initiatives, integrating digital technologies and optimizing industrial processes. My expertise in industrial automation, control systems, process optimization, and data analysis has been instrumental in driving improvements and achieving results in optimizing energy consumption.

**Background in:** Python, PLC Programming, Regulatory Process Control, Industry Process Data Driven Optimization.
